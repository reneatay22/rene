    <div class="fort">
        <h2>Cotta Fort (Fuerte de la Concepcion y del Triunfo)</h2>
        <p>Built in 1756, the fort was intended to repel the attacks of the Moro pirates, specifically for kidnapping people for slavery. In one battle alone, approximately 5,000 men lost their lives, according to Michael E. Fuentes, Ozamiz City spokesperson.</p>

        <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
        <p>Before Spanish colonization, the Subanens inhabited the area. The fort symbolizes strength and unity, reinforcing the aspirations of the Ozamiznons and Misamisnons for progress and solidarity.</p>

        <h3>Modern Relevance</h3>
        <p>Cotta Fort now serves as a beacon of knowledge, attracting visitors and the youth, offering a space for historical appreciation and community empowerment.</p>

        <h2>The Bells of Bukagan Hill</h2>
        <img src="buk.jpg" alt="Bukagan Hill">
        <img src="agan.jpg" alt="Bukagan Bells">
        <p>The four bells atop Bukagan Hill are named “St. Peter,” “St. Marien,” “St. Joseph,” and “St. Michael.” They were purchased by Bishop Patrick Cronin for Immaculate Conception Cathedral.</p>
        <p>Due to their size, the bells could not be housed in the church, leading to their installation on Bukagan Hill through the efforts of Ozamiz City Mayor Fernando T. Bernad.</p>

        <h3>Inauguration</h3>
        <p>The inauguration took place on July 16, 1948, attended by various community figures, symbolizing peace and friendship between different communities.</p>

        <h3>Visitor Experience</h3>

        <h2>Cotta Beach</h2>
        <img src="ca.jpg" alt="Cotta Beach">
        <img src="bea.jpg" alt="Cotta Beach View">
        <p>Cotta Beach is a small, black sand beach located in Ozamiz City, known for its beautiful sunrise views. The beach is a popular spot for local residents, who often come to swim or fish in the early morning hours.</p>
        <p>In addition to its natural beauty, Cotta Beach is home to several historical landmarks, including a Spanish Fort, a lighthouse, and the Cotta Shrine, all of which contribute to the beach's reputation as a well-known location.</p>
        <p>Visitors to Cotta Beach can enjoy a variety of street food options, although the area can become quite crowded, with limited space for recreational activities. It's also worth noting that the beach is located near a port, which can sometimes contribute to noise and air quality issues.</p>
