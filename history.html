        <h1>History of Ozamiz City</h1>

        <h2>Early Beginnings</h2>
        <p>Misamis was an old Spanish town, which existed as far back as the Spanish era and was conquered not by force of arms, but through faith by some Jesuit missionaries. The origin of the name “Misamis” is believed to have been derived from the Subano word “Kuyamis,” which is a variety of coconut. The name persisted as an inference of geographical location, and upon the advent of the Spanish settlers, the word “Kuyamis” easily gave way to the more conveniently pronounceable but corrupted word “Misamis.”</p>

        <p>By origin, Misamis was full of natives, particularly Subanos, the freedom-loving people in Northern Mindanao. Shortly before the coming of the Spaniards, Misamis was threatened by marauding pirates from the nearby provinces of Lanao. As a result, the Subanos migrated to the provinces of Misamis Oriental and Zamboanga del Norte, particularly Dapitan, where peace still reigned. Inhabitants from Bukidnon later retreated to Misamis, followed by a steady influx of settlers from Cebu and Bohol.</p>

        <h2>Cotta de Santiago: From History to Modern Day</h2>
        <p>In 1757, heightened by the piratical raids in the coastal towns of the archipelago, Misamis was chosen as the principal anchorage in Mindanao by the Spanish conquistadors. A stone fort known as “Cotta,” which took many years to complete, was built and still stands today. With the town and fort established, the seat of the Military Government was transferred from Iligan to Misamis. Later, the town of Misamis became the capital of the district, which in the 18th and 19th centuries embraced much of Northern Mindanao Province.</p>

        <p>During the Japanese occupation of Misamis in World War II (1943-1945), the “Cotta” was garrisoned by Japanese troops who dug foxholes near or under the walls. This undermining of the walls led to the destruction of the Southwest bastion in the earthquake of 1955.</p>

        <blockquote>
            Approximately three years after World War II, Misamis became a Chartered City on July 16, 1948, by virtue of House Bill No. 1656. This date coincides with the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The name Misamis was renamed Ozamiz City in honor of the late Senator Jose Ozamiz, who pioneered underground resistance activities against Japanese colonialists, was imprisoned at Fort Santiago, and ultimately executed at La Loma Cemetery.
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Ozamiz City's Growth and Development</h2>
        <p>Ozamiz has evolved immensely from an old Spanish settlement to its present enviable economic position in the region. It is now emerging as one of the fastest-growing cities in Northwestern Mindanao. Key developments include the establishment of essential infrastructure, which has boosted various sectors of the economy.</p>

        <p>The volume of trade and commerce has increased in recent years, aided by improved transportation facilities. The opening of the Oroquieta-Molave Road, a Kuwait Grant Project, is an asphalt concrete highway that provides easy access for north and south-bound commuters. Competition among barge companies has also enhanced connectivity across Panguil Bay from the Port of Ozamiz to Mucas port in Kolambugan del Norte.</p>

        <p>Modern shopping malls have flourished, offering a wide range of local and imported products at reasonable prices. The proliferation of commercial banks has increased from less than ten in the 1960s to more than twenty recently, indicating a progressive economy.</p>

        <blockquote>
            Rural development has progressed with the concreting of farm-to-market roads, enabling easy access for agricultural products to marketing channels. The development of a water supply system at Poliken Spring has utilized natural water resources, providing potable water to households in sixteen barangays that had never before been served.
        </blockquote>

        <p>The advent of cellular networks and landlines with digital direct dialing has benefited the business sector and attracted investors. With reliable 220 volts power and the lowest electricity rates in the region, the city has positioned itself favorably for future growth.</p>

        <p>Today, Ozamiz City is focused on pursuing development programs towards achieving sustainable growth and committing resources to respond to the needs of its constituents.</p>
